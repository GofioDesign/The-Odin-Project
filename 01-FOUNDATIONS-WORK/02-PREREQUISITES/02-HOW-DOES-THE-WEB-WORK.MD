# How does the web work?

## Introduction
  
Before you can understand how to program the web, you need a more rigorous understanding of the web itself than you likely have now. These concepts provide a more holistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working and will enable you to talk intelligently with other developers about your work.

## Lesson Overview
  
This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- Describe what the internet is.
  
- Describe what packets are and how they are used to transfer data.
  
- Understand the differences between a web page, web server, web browser and search engine.
  
- Briefly explain what a client is.
  
- Briefly explain what a server is.
  
- Explain what IP addresses are.
  
- Explain what DNS servers are.
  
## Assignment
